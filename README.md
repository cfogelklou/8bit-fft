# 8bit-fft
Embedded Fast Fourier Transform for 8-bit Processors

This source code is from an old project submitted as part of a project after
one of my stints working at Ubicom (previously Scenix).

I have learned a lot about programming since this was submitted, so quality
here is not guaranteed.  If I find time, I will try to add some unit tests
to make this code easier to use.

Please refer to the .doc file for more information on how to use this code.
