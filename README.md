# 8bit-fft

Embedded Fast Fourier Transform for 8-bit Processors

This source code is from an old project submitted as part of a report after
one of my stints working at Ubicom (previously Scenix). I am searching for the reference C code for some of the ASM functions, and when those are found, I will update this repository.

Please refer to the [.doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1F2PjXz6tsHRzdi8bXwY8HuU4c_b8Xio5lXjOBnAVo/edit?usp=sharing) file for more information on how to use this code.
